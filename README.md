# Animal Simulation

This project is a simple Java application that simulates different types of animals and their behaviors. Users can choose an animal (Bird, Cat, or Dog) and the program will display details about the selected animal, including what it eats, its sleeping habits, and the sound it makes.

## Features

- Choose from three types of animals: Bird, Cat, and Dog.
- Each animal has its own unique behaviors:
  - **Bird**: Eats seeds, sleeps for 10-12 hours, and makes a "Tweet, tweet" sound.
  - **Cat**: Eats fish, sleeps for 3-6 hours, and makes a "Meow, meow" sound.
  - **Dog**: Eats bones, sleeps for 7-9 hours, and makes a "Woof, woof" sound.

## Getting Started
